		<h2>power</h2>

			We went around several stages. I was watching a performance for a while in front of a stage when you tapped my shoulder with your finger. And then he started to laugh. Your smile was bright and white.
			“Why don’t we walk in the rain?”
			It was an unexpected offer. Playing in the rain is fun, I thought. I remembered my elementary school days. Because I had no reason to refuse, or because I wanted to obey you unconditionally, I closed my umbrella. You took a few steps and fell and turned around. You laughed, and I laughed along with you because I liked you so much. It was romantic to be in the rain with a girl I like at a rock festival.
			In the rain, talking and walking around, I followed you because you wanted to go smoke a cigarette. I foolishly took the cigarette you gave me and smoked it. But before you gave me the cigarette, you broke the capsule with your mouth and gave it to me. As I accepted the cigarette, the faint red lip marks, I was lost in thought. What does this mean? I sucked in the smoke and spit it out, thinking, but no answer came out.
